\title{Sample spatial points given a minimum distance between them}
\usage{
sample(dt, size, radius, spatialIndex)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{\code{\linkS4class{icesat2.atl08_dt}} data.table. Which can be extracted using
\code{\link[=ATL08_seg_attributes_dt]{ATL08_seg_attributes_dt()}}}

\item{size}{the sample size}

\item{radius}{the minimum radius between the points}

\item{spatialIndex}{the spatial index for accelerating the search
between points. default NULL will calculate a new ANN index tree.}
}
\value{
a subset sample of the input \code{\linkS4class{icesat2.atl08_dt}}
}
\description{
Sample spatial points given a minimum distance between them
}
\details{
This function uses a wrap around C++ ANN library from Mount and Arya (2010).
for calculating the nearest neighbors and including them in a taboo list
which won't be considered for the next sampling.
