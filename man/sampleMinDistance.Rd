\title{Sample spatial points given a minimum distance between them}
\usage{
sampleMinDistance(x, y, radius, nSamples, spatialIndex = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{NumericVector of x/longitude}

\item{y}{NumericVector of y/latitude}

\item{radius}{the minimum radius between the points}

\item{spatialIndex}{the spatial index for accelerating the search
between points. default NULL will calculate a new ANN index tree.}
}
\description{
Sample spatial points given a minimum distance between them
}
\details{
This function uses a wrap around C++ ANN library from Mount and Arya (2010).
for calculating the nearest neighbors and including them in a taboo list
which won't be considered for the next sampling.
