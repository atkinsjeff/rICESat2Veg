\usage{
ATL03_ATL08_photons_attributes_dt_join(atl08_h5, beam)
}
\arguments{
\item{atl03_h5}{A ICESat-2 ATL03 object (output of \code{\link[=ATL03_read]{ATL03_read()}} function).
An S4 object of class \code{\linkS4class{icesat2.atl03_dt}}.}

\item{atl08_h5}{A ICESat-2 ATL08 object (output of \code{\link[=ATL08_read]{ATL08_read()}} function).
An S4 object of class \link{icesat2.atl08_dt}.}

\item{beam}{Character vector indicating beams to process (e.g. "gt1l", "gt1r", "gt2l", "gt2r", "gt3l", "gt3r")}

\item{strong_beam_filter}{Logical. If true will only get strong beams, if FALSE will only
retrieve weak beams, if NULL or default won't filter the beams.}
}
\value{
Returns an S4 object of class \code{\linkS4class{icesat2.atl03atl08_dt}}
containing the ATL08 computed photons attributes.
}
\description{
This function joins ATL03 and ATL08 computed photons attributes
}
\details{
These are the photons attributes extracted by default:
\itemize{
\item \emph{lon_ph} Longitude of each received photon. Computed from the ECEF Cartesian coordinates of the bounce point.
\item \emph{lat_ph} Latitude of each received photon. Computed from the ECEF Cartesian coordinates of the bounce point.
\item \emph{lat_ph} Latitude of each received photon. Computed from the ECEF Cartesian coordinates of the bounce point.
Height of each received photon, relative to the WGS-84 ellipsoid including the geophysical corrections noted in section 6.0. Please note that
neither the geoid, ocean tide nor the dynamic atmospheric corrections (DAC) are applied to the ellipsoidal heights.
\item \emph{quality_ph} Indicates the quality of the associated photon. 0=nominal, 1=possible_afterpulse, 2=possible_impulse_response_
effect, 3=possible_tep. Use this flag in conjunction with signal_conf_ph to identify those photons that are likely noise or likely signal
\item \emph{night_flag}  Flag indicating the data were acquired in night conditions: 0=day, 1=night. Night flag is set when solar elevation is below 0.0 degrees.
\item \emph{ph_segment_id}  The elevation of the sun position vector from the reference photon bounce point position in the local ENU frame.
The angle is measured from the East-North plane and is positive Up. ATL03g provides this value in radians; it is converted to degrees for ATL03 output.
\item \emph{ph_segment_id} Georeferenced	bin	number (20-m) associated	with	each photon
\item \emph{classed_pc_indx} Indices of photons	tracking back	to ATL03	that	surface finding	software	identified and	used	within	the
creation of the	data products.
\item \emph{classed_pc_flag} The L2B algorithm is run if this flag is set to 1 indicating data have sufficient waveform fidelity for L2B to run
\item \emph{ph_h} Height of photon above interpolated ground surface
#'\item \emph{d_flag} Flag indicating	whether DRAGANN	labeled	the photon as noise or signal
\item \emph{delta_time} Mid-segment	GPS	time	in seconds past	an epoch. The epoch is provided	in the metadata	at the file	level
}
