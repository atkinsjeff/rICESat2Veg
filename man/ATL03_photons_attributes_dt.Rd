\usage{
ATL03_photons_attributes_dt(ATL03_h5, beam)
}
\arguments{
\item{beam}{Character vector indicating beams to process (e.g. "gt1l", "gt1r", "gt2l", "gt2r", "gt3l", "gt3r")}

\item{ATL03_h5}{A ICESat-2 ATL03 object (output of \code{\link[=ATL03_read]{ATL03_read()}} function).
An S4 object of class \link{icesat2.atl03_dt}.}
}
\value{
Returns an S4 object of class \link[data.table:data.table]{data.table::data.table}
containing the ATL03 photons attributes.
}
\description{
This function extracts photons attributes from ICESat-2 ATL03 data
}
\details{
These are the photons attributes extracted:
\itemize{
\item \emph{lon_ph} Longitude of each received photon. Computed from the ECEF Cartesian coordinates of the bounce point.
\item \emph{lat_ph} Latitude of each received photon. Computed from the ECEF Cartesian coordinates of the bounce point.
\item \emph{lat_ph} Latitude of each received photon. Computed from the ECEF Cartesian coordinates of the bounce point.
Height of each received photon, relative to the WGS-84 ellipsoid including the geophysical corrections noted in section 6.0. Please note that
neither the geoid, ocean tide nor the dynamic atmospheric corrections (DAC) are applied to the ellipsoidal heights.
\item \emph{quality_ph} Indicates the quality of the associated photon. 0=nominal, 1=possible_afterpulse, 2=possible_impulse_response_
effect, 3=possible_tep. Use this flag in conjunction with signal_conf_ph to identify those photons that are likely noise or likely signal
\item \emph{night_flag}  Flag indicating the data were acquired in night conditions: 0=day, 1=night. Night flag is set when solar elevation is below 0.0 degrees.
